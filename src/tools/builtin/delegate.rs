//! delegate_task — port of hermes' tools/delegate_tool.py
//!
//! Spawns one or more sub-agents in isolated contexts. The actual agent
//! execution is provided by the `SubAgentRunner` installed on the context
//! (implemented by `Agent`), keeping tools/ free of an agent dependency.
//!
//! Background semantics (hermes v2026.8.3): top-level delegations run in
//! the background automatically — dispatch returns immediately with a
//! delegation id and live-log paths, and ONE consolidated result re-enters
//! the conversation when all children finish (see `async_delegation`).
//! Orchestrator subagents (depth > 0) stay synchronous because they need
//! their workers' results within their own turn. Sessions that cannot
//! receive detached results (one-shot runners) fall back to synchronous
//! execution with an explanatory note.

             DO NOT USE FOR: mechanical multi-step work (use execute_code), a single tool call \
             (call the tool directly), tasks needing user interaction (subagents cannot ask \
             questions), or durable work that must survive this session (use cronjob or \

             'context'. Child summaries are SELF-REPORTS, not verified facts: verify external \
             side effects (fetch the URL, read back the file) before reporting success.",
